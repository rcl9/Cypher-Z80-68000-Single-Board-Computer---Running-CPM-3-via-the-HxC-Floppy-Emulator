# This is the Motel Computers 1k sector file format
#
# 2k block size, 8 sectors / track, 1k sectors, skew 3, 128 directory entries,
# 2 reserved system tracks
# Use OS = 2.2 so that date stamps and directory labels are not placed in the directory table
# RCL, I change the # of directory entries from 64 to 128 on Dec 22 2017 only because that was listed in diskio3.asm of the Cypher source code
