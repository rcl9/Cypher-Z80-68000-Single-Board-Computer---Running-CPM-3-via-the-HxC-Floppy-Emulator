The contents of this directory are used to create the virtual CP/M-3 boot image for the 
Cypher SBC and the HxC drive emulator attached to Drive A. 

Basically all you need to do is run "makedisk.bat" then use the HxC emulator software to convert the cyphboot.img file into 
startupa.hfe for the root directory of the HxC emulator's SDCARD.
